**Key Findings**

The analysis of the bank customer dataset reveals several critical patterns that highlight why customers are leaving the bank. The overall churn rate of 20.37% shows that nearly one in five customers has exited, indicating a substantial retention challenge. Inactive customers form a major portion of churn, demonstrating that low engagement directly increases the likelihood of exit. Additionally, customers with only one product show a significantly higher churn rate compared to those holding two products, suggesting that lack of product involvement decreases customer loyalty.

Geographical patterns indicate that customers in Germany exhibit the highest churn rate—more than double that of France and Spain. This implies region-specific dissatisfaction that must be addressed. Furthermore, churn is seen even among customers with medium and high account balances, which is concerning because these customers typically contribute more revenue to the bank. Gender-wise analysis indicates that female customers churn slightly more, and mid-aged customers show more dissatisfaction compared to younger groups. These findings collectively highlight the various attributes influencing churn.


**CONCLUSION:**

In conclusion, the churn analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and the main factors that contribute to customer attrition in the banking sector. The results clearly indicate that churn is influenced by product participation, customer engagement, demographic factors, and regional differences. Problems such as low activity levels, single-product usage, and region-specific dissatisfaction significantly contribute to the overall churn rate. Additionally, the exit of high-balance customers suggests service issues or unmet expectations among valuable customer segments.

Overall, the project emphasizes the necessity for the bank to adopt data-driven strategies to reduce churn. With the insights generated through SQL and Power BI, the bank can now focus on targeted customer engagement, improved service delivery, and personalized product offerings. Implementing the recommended strategies will not only help reduce churn but also strengthen long-term customer loyalty and profitability.


**SUGGESTIONS**

To reduce churn, the bank should focus on increasing customer engagement and strengthening relationships with inactive and single-product customers. Introducing reward programs, personalized recommendations, and product bundles can encourage customers to adopt more banking services, thereby improving their retention. High-value customers, especially those with larger account balances, should be given priority support, relationship managers, and exclusive benefits to encourage loyalty.

Region-specific strategies should be developed, especially in Germany where churn rates are highest. Improving customer service quality, understanding local market competition, and redesigning credit card and banking product benefits can significantly help reduce dissatisfaction. Addressing female customer needs through specialized offerings may also help improve retention. Overall, targeted customer engagement, better service quality, and personalized product enhancements can greatly minimize churn and improve the overall customer experience.
